# Spotify_Wrapper

Our Spotify Wrapped Project allows users to find their Spotify listening statistics similar to Spotify Wrapped using Django and the Spotify API. They can click a button to generate their Spotify Wrapped after logging into their Spotify account, and then discover different features.

## Motivation

We wanted to create an interactive website to empower users to explore their unique music preferences at any time through personalized listening statistics and an engaging and interactive experience that celebrates the intersection of music and technology.

## Tech/Frameworks Used

We used Python in the Django framework as well as HTML for structure and design.

## API Reference

We used the Spotify API.

## Installation

Install Python 3.9, Django 4.2.16, pillow 10.4.0, python-dotenv 1.0.1, requests 2.32.3
